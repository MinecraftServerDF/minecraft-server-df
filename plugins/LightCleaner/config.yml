# The minimum amount of memory (in MB) allowed while processing chunk lighting
# If the remaining free memory drops below this value, measures are taken to reduce it
# Memory will be Garbage Collected and all worlds will be saved to free memory
# The process will be stalled for so long free memory is below this value

# Sets whether lighting is cleaned up for newly generated chunks
# This will eliminate dark shadows during world generation

# How many chunks are asynchronously loaded at the same time
# Setting this value too high may overflow the internal queues. Too low and it will idle too much.
